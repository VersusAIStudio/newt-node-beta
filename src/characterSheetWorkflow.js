Keep the same foundation clothing consistently across all views wherever it is visible within the existing panel crops; do not reframe a close-up to show the clothing.

Change only the character's clothing, footwear, and requested wearable accessories. Study the selected wardrobe reference and transfer only its garments, materials, colors, construction, fit, footwear, and styling onto the locked character. Ignore every person, face, body, pose, environment, background, text, label, and unrelated object in the wardrobe reference.

Apply exactly one complete, consistent outfit across all six views, including clothing visible near the neckline in close-up panels. The wardrobe reference is a single layered outfit, not a menu of alternatives: wear its inner layers, outerwear, footwear, and wearable accessories together in every view where visible. If the reference includes a coat or jacket, keep it on in both body panels and the close-ups; do not show coat-off alternatives or different stages of dressing. Do not invent garments or accessories absent from the reference. Referenced headwear may naturally cover hair without changing the character's underlying hairstyle or head shape. Replace the neutral foundation swimwear or existing reference garment completely wherever the selected outfit should cover the body. Return one complete, seamless sheet with naturally connected heads, necks, shoulders, and clothing, never an isolated edit patch or pasted face cutouts.
